## Main Purpose 💡

The main purpose of this project is to learn React Native and its potential for building mobile applications that can run on both Android and iOS devices.

🌍 I'm working on this project because of the inspiration from the Turkish earthquake application built by volunteers who quickly organized and published an app for every device to help those affected by the earthquake. This project aims to learn React Native so that I can contribute to society and publish useful applications that can help people in times of need.
